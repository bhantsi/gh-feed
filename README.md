# gh-feed

**gh-feed** is a simple command-line tool written in Python that fetches and displays a GitHub user's recent public activity directly in the terminal.  
It uses the GitHub API and works with no external libraries.

## üöÄ Features

- Fetches the most recent public events for any GitHub user.
- Supports a variety of event types: push, issues, pull requests, stars, forks, releases, comments, and more.
- Colorizes output for better readability in the terminal.
- Summarizes activity by event type and repository count.
- Allows filtering events by type using the `--filter <event_type>` flag.
- Exports the latest events to a JSON file with the `--json` flag.
- Gracefully handles errors like invalid usernames, rate limits, and connection issues.
- Warns you when you're nearing GitHub's rate limit.
- Shows relative timestamps (e.g., "2h ago") for each event.
- Requires no external dependencies‚Äîpure Python standard library.
- Interactive mode for guided usage.
- Caches API responses for faster repeated queries.
- Supports GitHub API authentication via personal access token (`--token <token>` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 (comes pre-installed on most systems)

### Running the CLI

After installation, you can run the CLI from anywhere:

```bash
gh-feed <github_username>
```

Or, if you want to run the script directly (if you have the source):

```bash
python3 app.py <github_username>
```

### Filtering Events

You can filter by event type (e.g., only show push events):

```bash
gh-feed octocat --filter PushEvent
```

### Exporting to JSON

Export the latest events to a file:

```bash
gh-feed octocat --json
```

You can combine filtering and export:

```bash
gh-feed octocat --filter IssuesEvent --json
```

### Using a GitHub Token

To increase your API rate limit, you can provide a personal access token:

```bash
gh-feed octocat --token <your_github_token>
```

Or set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
gh-feed octocat
```

### Interactive Mode

Start an interactive session for guided usage:

```bash
gh-feed --interactive
```
You'll be prompted for the username, event filter, token, and export options.

### Caching

API responses are cached for 5 minutes in the `.gh_feed_cache/` directory to reduce API calls and speed up repeated queries.

### Example

```bash
gh-feed octocat
```

Sample output:
```
- Pushed 2 commits to octocat/Hello-World (3h ago)
- Opened an issue in octocat/Hello-World (5h ago)
- Starred octocat/Spoon-Knife (1d ago)

Summary:
- push commit: 1
- issue opened: 1
- repo starred: 1
- Activity in 3 repos
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The tool uses the public GitHub API, which is subject to [rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). If you make too many requests in a short period, you may be temporarily blocked from making further requests.
- Only public events are shown. Private activity will not appear.
- If you see a warning about nearing the rate limit, wait a while before making more requests.
- Make sure you have an active internet connection.
- The tool displays up to 7 of the most recent events.
- Cached data is stored in `.gh_feed_cache/` and is valid for 5 minutes.
