## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 (comes pre-installed on most systems)

### Running the CLI

```bash
chmod +x app.py
./app.py <github_username>
```

Or run directly with Python:

```bash
python3 app.py <github_username>
```

### Filtering Events

You can filter by event type (e.g., only show push events):

```bash
python3 app.py octocat --filter PushEvent
```

### Exporting to JSON

Export the latest events to a file:

```bash
python3 app.py octocat --json
```

You can combine filtering and export:

```bash
python3 app.py octocat --filter IssuesEvent --json
```

### Example

```bash
python3 app.py octocat
```

Sample output:
```
- Pushed 2 commits to octocat/Hello-World (3h ago)
- Opened an issue in octocat/Hello-World (5h ago)
- Starred octocat/Spoon-Knife (1d ago)

Summary:
- push commit: 1
- issue opened: 1
- repo starred: 1
- Activity in 3 repos
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The tool uses the public GitHub API, which is subject to [rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting). If you make too many requests in a short period, you may be temporarily blocked from making further requests.
- Only public events are shown. Private activity will not appear.
- If you see a warning about nearing the rate limit, wait a while before making more requests.
- Make sure you have an active internet connection.
- The tool displays up to 7 of the most recent events.
